- `journalctl -b 0` to see logs generated since current boot (to see previous boot use `-1`)
- `journalctl -S 14:00 -U 15:00` to see logs from 2pm to 3pm can be used for dates too
- `journalctl _COMM=sudo` to see logs related to sudo activity
- `journalctl -p err` show only error-level logs (other options include: emerg, alert, crit, emerg, warning etc)


**OTHERS**
- `last` to see login history
