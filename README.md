# Hard links and Soft links

In this project, I demonstrate how to create hard and soft links in Linux. A hard link is a pointer to a file, and a soft (symbolic) link is like a shortcut. Hereâ€™s how I created a hard link for an image file.

## Task 1 hard link:
I created a hard link for an image of a rose located in my `image` folder under `docs` to be linked to `myfolder` for the `david`
user.


### Steps taken:
 1 First I had to create the new user david using  `sudo useradd david`
 	
 2 Then use mkdir to create the new folder myfolder and images

 3 Now I can use my ln command to create the hard link `sudo  ln /home/debbie/linux-commands-showcase/myfolder/docs/images/rose.jpeg /home/david/myfolder/images`

## Task 2 soft link:
Since soft link is not limited to files like hard links I am making a soft link of `myfolder` under the user `debbie` to `myfolder` in the user `david`

Command used: `sudo ln -s /home/debbie/linux-commands-showcase/myfolder /home/david/myfolder`

# Special Permissions in Linux: SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit

## Task 1 SUID (Set User ID)  

Allows users to run an executable file as if they are the owner of the file

### Steps taken:

1 Create a file named suidfile using command touch 

2 using `chmod 4664 suidfile`


## Task 2 SUIG (Set Group ID)

When set on a directory, all new files inside it inherit the group of the directory, not the userâ€™s default group.


### Steps taken:

1 Create a file named suigfile using command touch

2 using `chmod 2664 suidfile`

## Task 3 Sticky bit 
Used on shared directories to allow users to create files but only delete their own files.


### Steps taken:

1 Create a file named suigfile using command touch

2 using `chmod 1664 stickybitfile`

Note I did not add execute permissions for any user groups which is why the permissions have been capitalised

## Filtering files based on size, name, permissions and time 

### by size

Command used: `find . -size +1k` to find files more than 1 kilobyte for less than 1 kilobyte use `-1k` 

### by name

Command used: `find . -name 'suigfile'`  I can also use `-i` to make it not case sensitive 

### by file type

Command used: `find . -name '*.png'`

### by permission

Command used: `find . -perm /4000` to find files with SUID permission and `2000` and `1000` for SUIG and Sticky bit permissions

To find for any special permissions use `7000` because the value of all permissions together is `4+2+1= 7` 

Also `/4000` means any of these permissions `-4000` at least these permissions and `4000` exactly those permissions

### by time

Command used: `find . -mtime -2` finds files modified in the last 2 days to find for more than 2 days use `+2`

`find . -mmin -10` finds files modified in the last 10 mins if it was more than 10 mins it would be `+10`

`find . -atime -2` finds files based on last access in this case that is in the last 2 days `+2` would mean more than 2 days

### by type

Command used: `find . -type f` this is to find regular files `d` to find directories 

### Filtering with and, or, not 

Commands used: 

`find . -perm /7000 -size +1k` this implies an and operator
`find . -perm /7000 -o -size +1k` the `-o` option shows that this is an or operator
`find . -not -name 's*'` the `not` option shows that this is a not operator
